Flask application skeleton
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have my own ideas about how a Flask application should be organized, and I
got tired of redoing the same steps every time I created a new project, so...

How to use this:

 1. Copy this directory.
 2. Run the setup script.
 3. Edit the database URL and HTTP port in .env.
 4. Work.
